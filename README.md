# sample-ts-server

Used for quickly getting started on new typescript server projects

## Setup
1. clone this repository or just download its files
2. Drag these folders/files into your new server project's repo
3. Go to new project's repo and `npm init` then make sure your new package.json looks correct
4. `npm i`
5. start building

- Can easily use firebase auth, heroku deployment, custom slack logs, & custom error handling
- Also, you should use `npm run dev` to run the new project during development. This way it is easy to see when project is in prod vs dev (used for error logs and developer convenience like auto server restart on file changes).
